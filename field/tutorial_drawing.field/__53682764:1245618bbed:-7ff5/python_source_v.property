string># how to draw a line on the canvas

# first we make a line object 
line = PLine()

# now we can draw into it

# first lets move to 50,100 Ñ note that 0,0 is in the top left hand corner of the window
line.moveTo(50,100)

# and then let's go to (200,150)
line.lineTo(200, 150)

# lets add that to the list of things that this box draws

_self.lines.clear() # first we clear the drawing list
_self.lines.add(line)
