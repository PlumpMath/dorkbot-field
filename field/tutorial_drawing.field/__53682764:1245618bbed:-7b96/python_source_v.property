string># how to draw a curve on the canvas

line = PLine()

# start at this position
line.moveTo(50,100)

# curve towards (100,150) then towards (200,100) and then end up at (200,150)
line.cubicTo(100, 150, 200, 100, 200, 150)

# and then, translate this curve 200 to the right to get it out of the way of the other example
line += Vector2(200,0)

_self.lines.clear() # first we clear the drawing list
_self.lines.add(line) # then we add the line
