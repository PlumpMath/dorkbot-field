# while you can drag the red line around with the mouse, Field wouldn't be Field if you couldn't do it from code

# try executing this line by itself
_self.timeSlider.frame.x=200

# then this one
_self.timeSlider.frame.x=0

# there's nothing too surprising about this. You can set 'frame.x=something' on anything in the canvas

#for example
_self.frame.x += 10

#or:
_self.find["animated time"].frame.y+=10
